Finally, I've updated the design of [javascript-minifier.com](/) to the latest version of Bootstrap, v3.0.3 to be precise.

I'd been meaning to do this for a while and finally found some time. I think the site looks a bit cleaner now than
before so I hope you like it.

As well as changing the Bootstrap version, I also took the opportunity to link to files on the
[jsdelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/) site. This is both the Bootstrap css and js files but also the version of jQuery
too. If you're using IE<9, then it'll also link to the same place for the `html5shiv.js` and `respond.js`, so you'll
get an even better speedup. The site loads fast anyway but hopefully this will make it even faster.
